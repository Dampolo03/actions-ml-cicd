## Demonstrations and Resources For Machine Learning CI/CD With GitHub Actions

Read [this article](https://blog.paperspace.com/ci-cd-for-machine-learning-ai/) for a primer on what CI/CD for Machine Learning is and where it differs from traditional CI/CD .

### GitHub Actions That Enable CI/CD For Machine Learning

- Submitting Argo Workflows (machine learning pipelines on Kubernetes): [GKE version](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/submit-argo-workflows-to-gke), [Cloud agnostic version](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/submit-argo-workflows-from-github)
- Publishing Docker Images to the GitHub Package Registry: [Actions marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/publish-docker-images-to-gpr)
